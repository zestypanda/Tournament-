# Tournament-Planner
Build a Swiss-system Tournament Planner using PostgreSQL database and Python DB-API

A Swiss-system tournament is a kind of sports tournament in which players are not eliminated when they lose a match, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

1) Create a PostgreSQL database with normalized tables of players and matches.
2) Support player registration, match recording, tournament planning through Python DB-API psycopg2 library.
