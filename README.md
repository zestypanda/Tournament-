# Tournament-Planner
Build a Swiss-system Tournament Planner using PostgreSQL database and Python DB-API

A Swiss-system tournament is a kind of sports tournament in which players are not eliminated when they lose a match, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

1) Built a database backed application that determines the winner of a Swiss-system game tournament.
2) Developed a database schema to store the game matches between players.
3) Used PostgreSQL database and Python DB-API psycopg2 library to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.
